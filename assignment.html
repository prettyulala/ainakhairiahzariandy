<p align="justify">I am Nur Aina Khairiah Binti Zariandy. I am 20 years old. Currently, i am a student at UiTM  Kampus Machang, Kelantan, in the last semester this year. I am pursuing a diploma in Information Management. I am a self-motivated and responsible person, friendly, helpful and polite and also have a good sense of humour. I am able to work independently in busy enviroments and also within a team setting. And i like to work in group with other person because from there i can add some of new friends. I love to have a lot of friends.</p>
<p align="justify">I also can have a good communication with others. This is because i like to talk and change opinions with the others. Usually, i like to talk about experience and the current issue with the people. I am an outgoing person with a good sense of humor and I make friends easily. My friends say that I am funny and fun to be with. I sometimes go out of my way to be nice to people and help them out. I guess this is rooted in my sense of responsibility which was honed into me by my parents considering that I am the first born of my family. Friendship and family mean a lot to me. I can go all out for my friends and my family and they know it. I think this is why I have had the same set of friends for years. We have transitioned from friends to family.
<p align="justify">Iâ€™m always looking for ways to develop my skills and learn new things not just in my course that i had learn but also outside the university environment. I share ideas with my friends, we learn interesting things about one another, and most of the people I associate with I met with while on the lookout for ways to advance my skills.</p>
